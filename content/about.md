CodeThat.today is a site for all developers wanting to learn new technologies and best practices. We write practical guides, in-depth tutorials and step-by-step articles. We also give expert opinions and recommendations about the best uses of a particular technology so that the reader can make informed decisions.

Hello there. My name is Theo and I'm the person behind this website. I'm a Senior Developer by trade and in love of Web Technologies. 
Writing code and solving problems was always my passion. I created this site, so I can share my experiences with the fellow readers and 
also to learn new things myself!

In addition to my engineering work, I like to help other people learn how to code. I'm currently a mentor with [CodeInstitute](https://codeinstitute.net/) and [CodeMentor](https://www.codementor.io/theofanisdespoudis).

Feel free to get in touch via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nerdokto) or [Dev.to](https://dev.to/theodesp).
