Hi. My name is Theo and I'm the person behind this website. I'm a Senior Developer by trade and in love of Web Technologies. Writing code and solving problems is always my passion.

In addition to my engineering work, I like to help other people learn how to code. I'm currently a mentor with [CodeInstitute](https://codeinstitute.net/) and [CodeMentor](https://www.codementor.io/theofanisdespoudis).
